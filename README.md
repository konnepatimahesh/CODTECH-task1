# Objective **
The primary objective of the Simple Calculator project is to develop a basic arithmetic calculator application that can perform fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator aims to provide a user-friendly interface and accurate results for these operations.

# Key Activities
  1.Requirement Analysis: Identify the essential functionalities and operations the calculator should perform.
  2.Design: Create a simple, intuitive user interface (UI) for the calculator, including buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and a display area.
  3.Implementation:
    1.Develop the calculator's core functionality to handle arithmetic operations.
    2.Implement the user interface.
    3.Integrate event handling to ensure that button clicks result in the appropriate operations being performed.
  4.Testing:
    1.Unit testing to verify the accuracy of the mathematical operations.
    2.User interface testing to ensure the buttons and display work correctly.

# Technologies Used
  1. Programming Languages:
  2. Python: For the core functionality and logic.

# Tests:
  1.test_calculator.py (unit tests for core functions)
# Documentation:
 1. README.md (project overview and setup instructions)
 2.user_guide.pdf (instructions for using the calculator)

   This overview serves as a foundational guide to planning, developing, and deploying a simple calculator application. The specific technologies and tools can be adapted based on the 
   project's requirements.
