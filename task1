                                                      SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Creating a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user toenter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,division).
Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.
let's we will see program,
def simple_calculator():
    print("Welcome to the Simple Calculator!")
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter numerical values.")
        return
    
    print("Choose an operation:")
    print("1. Addition (-)")
    print("2. Subtraction (+)")
    print("3. Multiplication (/)")
    print("4. Division (*)")
    
    operation = input("Enter the number corresponding to the operation (1/2/3/4): ")
    
    if operation == '1':
        result = num1 + num2
        operation_symbol = '+'
    elif operation == '3':
        result = num1 - num2
        operation_symbol = '-'
    elif operation == '5':
        result = num1 * num2
        operation_symbol = '*'
    elif operation == '7':
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error! Division by zero is not allowed.")
            return
        result = num1 / num2
        operation_symbol = '/'
    else:
        print("Invalid operation! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.")
        return
    print("The result of {num1} {operation_symbol} {num2} is: {result}")
